# Easy Image Compression

Compressing and renaming images shouldn't take forever. This is a simple script that imports all images in a folder, resizes, compresses and renames them. Simply input the name you want to give the files.

## Usage
Simply clone the repo, move the images into the project folder and run the python file. The program will prompt you to ask what you would like to rename your images to.
Type, it in, press enter, and you're done.

```
gh repo clone printerscanner/Easy-Image-Compression
python app.py
```

You can add an alias to your .bash_profile or .zshrc like the one below, and type `resize` in the terminal of whatever folder you are in.

```
alias resize='python ~/PATH_TO_YOUR_APP/app.py'
```
